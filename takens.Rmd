# Introduction



It has been long known to physicists that the *state space* of a physical system can be best described as a topological manifold.

```

`r tufte::newthought("Here")` is what

::: {.example name="Simple Pendulum"}
The state of a simple pendulum, freely swinging under the gravitational force, can be completely described by the pair $(\theta,\dot{\theta})$, where $\theta$ is the angular displacement of the blob from its vertical position and $\dot{\theta}$ its angular velocity. In other words, knowing the numbers $\theta$ and $\dot{\theta}$ at a given time fully unravels the configuration or state of the pendulum at that particular moment of its motion. Also, knowing just one of them is not enough. If I showed you a picture of the pendulum clicked exactly when it was just vertical (i.e. $\theta=0$), you would not be able to tell whether it was swinging left-to-right or right-to-left when the snapshot was taken. So, it takes no less than two components to describe the state space. We call it a two-dimensional system.

::: {.definition name="Diffeomorphism"}
Let $M,N$ be smooth manifolds. A bijective map $f:M\to N$ is called a *diffeomorphism* if it is smooth, bijective, and its inverse is smooth. If there exists a diffeomorphism, the manifolds are called *diffeomorphic*.
